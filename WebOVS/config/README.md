# Running Configures

The ./lighttpd folder is the configure files of lighttpd, which is located in
/etc/lighttpd.
The ./startup.sh is commands to start up lighttpd.

The configure files of lighttpd is incomplete for running. I only commit the
files I modified. If you want to start lighttpd, please install lighttpd and
replace files here.
