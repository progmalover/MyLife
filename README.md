### Learning map?

Have finish:
- C/C++ and STL(Demo/cpp_demo Demo/cpp_demo/stl), need re-learn sometime.

- python(Demo/python_demo/ server_demo web_demo), basic python and library:
    -- web
    -- server
    -- oslo.config
    -- setuptool
    -- eventlet
- OVS, need continue work on opensource discuss and patch:

    -- OVS ofproto layer and flow table, nfv_sdn/extend_ovs/old_comments/ovs/.

Learning:
- OVS datapath and TCPIP/NFV kernel code programing:
    -- OVS datapath: https://github.com/batmancn/ovs, 2_3_comment. Important is kernel programing in OVS datapath.
    -- kernel networking TCP and SOCKET, Demos/linux_demo/kernel_demo/kernel_networking.md, and https:/github.com/batmancn/linux.git. 
    -- iproute2 and its architecture, linux bridge, iptables.

    -- neutron server
    -- ovs plugin
    -- ODL plugin
    -- l3 agent and vrouter.
- Java & ODL:
    -- yang
    -- osgi

For long term:
- Java and ODL. This is neccessary. Controller, BGP etc.
- nginx/HTTP.
