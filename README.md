### Learning map?

Have finish:
- C/C++ and STL(Demo/cpp_demo Demo/cpp_demo/stl), need re-learn sometime.
    -- cplusplus.com
- python(Demo/python_demo/ server_demo web_demo), basic python and library:
    -- web, server
    -- Neutron: oslo.config, oslo.messaging, neutron.callbacks
    -- setuptool
    -- eventlet
    -- Rabbit MQ: amqplib
    -- json, argparse, subprocess, re, refer ovs_invd_demo.py.
- OVS, need continue work on opensource discuss and patch:
    -- OVS datapath basic packet flow, nfv_sdn/extend_ovs/old_comments/datapath/README.md.
    -- OVS ofproto layer and flow table, nfv_sdn/extend_ovs/old_comments/ovs/.

Learning:
- OVS datapath and TCPIP/NFV kernel code programing:
    -- OVS datapath: https://github.com/batmancn/ovs, 2_3_comment. Important is kernel programing in OVS datapath.
    -- kernel networking TCP and SOCKET, Demos/linux_demo/kernel_demo/kernel_networking.md, and https:/github.com/batmancn/linux.git. 
    -- iproute2 and its architecture, linux bridge, iptables.
- neutron code and development and intergration with ODL, https://github.com/batmancn/neutron.git, comment_mitaka.
    -- neutron server
    -- ovs plugin
    -- ODL plugin
    -- l3 agent and vrouter.
- Java & ODL:
    -- yang
    -- osgi

For long term:
- Java and ODL. This is neccessary. Controller, BGP etc.
- kernel programing.
- nginx/HTTP:
    -- basic usage, like linux bridge, iptables.
    -- http related module source code, important to learn http.
    -- no need to read code like OVS.
- python:
    -- Rabbit MQ
    -- neutron RPC summary
- webrtc/JS.

Consider to learn or not:
- openstack tacker.


### temp record like TBD in evenote?

It seems like ODL is neccessary in SDN!
